Version 20180405.1
!! code largely rewritten !!
- code changed to fortran95
- dynamic allocation
- openmp directives for shared memory parallelization
- multiple source

Version 20181219.1
- correction for bugs pointed out by M. VallÃ©e (IPGP)
  - wrong size allocation for rr(nr) -> rr(nr*ns)
- changed double = comparison with something more appropriate (doubleEquality())
- write result in buffer mode to speed up writing process whith openmp (reflect5.f90)

Version 20190404.1
- corrected bug in dll2km when computing min,max of station coordinates in lat,lon

Version 20190611.1
- corrected bug in initdata.f90, nzrr and nzss were not initialized to 0

Version 20200806.1
- add suffix to all files to allow multiple configuration/result to exist in the same place
  (axitra [suffix] and convms [suffix])
- add python wrappers
- simplify use of user provided source time function
- nr,ns,nc number of sources, receivers and layers are determined from input file and removed from namelist
- xl and tl can be computed automatically by axitra if set to <=0
- correct bug on dirac and ricker source time function that were not normalized

Version 20201104.1
- correct bug introduced in previous version taht affect convergence in some cases

Version 20201113.1
- correct bug in convmPy where displacement were not ordered according to station indices
- replace real(kind=8) by a fortran2003 generic type using iso_fortran_env
- change axitra.py to use more class declaration and add functions

Version 20201214.1
- suppress reordering of source and receiver in the files and add a sort routine in convm
 This correct a bug in convm(f)Py

Version 20212403.1
- correct dirac source time function normalization w/r FFT, 
  add an option to convm to obtain source time function only (no convolution)
- move parameter.o compilation on head of OBJ2
- correct convmPy like convm
- change coefs in fsource
- more help information in axitra.py for convolution
- add a test example to check low frequency amplitude spectrum versus moment
- fix SAC scale header value to default instead of 0 to conform to ObsPy
